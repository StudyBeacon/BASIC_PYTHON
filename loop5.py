# Instructions

# “Are we there yet?” is a phrase that has existed for as long as there are children, vehicles, and road trips.

# First, ask the user “Are we there yet?” using the input() function and store it in an answer variable.

# Then, create a while loop that asks the user “Are we there yet?” again. Keep asking them this over and over until they respond with “Yes”.

# The output could look something like this:

# Are we there yet? One more hour
# Are we there yet? Almost there
# Are we there yet? Don't make me pull over
# Are we there yet? Yes
